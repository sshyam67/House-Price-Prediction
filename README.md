## 📍 Project Overview

This project predicts housing prices using multiple regression models. It aims to help potential buyers, real estate investors, and agencies make data-driven decisions.

The model is trained on features like:
- Area (sq.ft)
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Location
- Amenities (balcony, parking, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧼 Data cleaning and outlier removal  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- 🧠 Trained multiple regression models  
- 🔍 Compared Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest  
- 📉 Evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics  
- 📈 Visualized predictions vs. actual prices

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle / UCI Repository / Custom]  
- Format: CSV  
- Size: ~1,300 rows × 9 columns  
- Target Variable: `price`  
- Feature Examples: `area`, `bedrooms`, `location`, `balcony`, `parking`
